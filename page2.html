    <h3>An officer walks up to you and asks to talk.</h3>
    <h3>You keep hearing the <b>detained</b> word throw around.</h3>
    <h3>What does <b>detained</b> even mean?</h3>
    <div><p><b>DETAINED:</b> during an <i>investigation</i>, an officer may keep you in their <i>custody</i> until they are certain <b>you</b> have not committed a crime.</p>
      <p>Until the <b>officer</b> states you may <i>leave,</i> or are <i>free to go</i>, it is best to assume you are still <b>detained</b>.
        <h3>How do I know if I am <b>detained</b>?</h3>
        <p>Apart from asking the <b>officer</b>, you may use context clues to determine if you are <i>free to leave</i>.</p>
        <p>For instance, if an officer has pulled you over for a <b>Traffic Stop</b>, you are <b>detained</b>.</p>
        <p>In most jurisdictions, an officer <i>MUST</i> have their emergency vehicle lights active during a <b>Traffic Stop</b> in order to detain you.</p>
        <h3>That's simple, but what about if it isn't a traffic stop?</h3>
        <p>Sometimes, it is best to <b>politely ask</b> the officer if you are free to leave.</p>
        <p>Instead of asking, <i>"Am I being detained?"</i>, try asking, <b>"Am I free to leave, or do you need me to stay?"</b></p>
        <p>What you ask is less important than how you ask it.</p>
        <p>Also, always remember being a <b>VICTIM</b> of a crime means you are <b>INVOLVED</b> in the crime. Yes, as a victim, <b>you are detained.</b></p>
        <h3>Okay, but I didn't commit a crime!</h3>
        <p>The officer likely knows something you <b>don't know</b>.</p>
        <p>A simple example is a crime was committed in the area and you fit the description of the perpetrator.</p>
        <p>The more willing you are to comply with the officer, the faster the officer can check your story and release you.</p>
        <h3>Ask questions, but be respectful of the officer's time.</h3>
        <p>The more respectful you are to the officer, the more willing the officer will be to answer all your questions.</p>
        <h3>The officer said I was <b>FREE TO LEAVE</b> but is in my way or grabbed me.</h3>
        <p>This is <i>illegal</i> and will be covered under <b>UNLAWFUL ACTIONS BY AN OFFICER</b>.</p>

        <h1>REMEMBER:</h1>
        <p>To detain, an officer must have reasonable suspicion that a crime was committed and you were involved.</p>
        <p>They do not have to tell you their reason, but do have to tell you if you are detained.</p>
        <p>If you feel your rights have been violated, get a copy of the police report at your local police station and contact a lawyer.</p>
