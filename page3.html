<h1>"I am going to <b>detain you</b> <i>in handcuffs.</i>"</h1>
<h3>Hold the @$#%ing phone. Did that <b>OFFICER</b> just say he is <i>ARRESTING</i> me?!</h3>
<p>In short, no. The officer is still <b>DETAINING</b> you, which I covered under the <b>DETAINED</b> page.</p>
<p>Being detained means you are involved in an investigation of a possible crime, whether that is...</p>
<ul style="font-size: 24px">
  <li>Traffic Violation</li>
  <li>Domestic Situation</li>
  <li>911 Phone Call</li>
  <li>Victim of a Crime</li>
</ul>
<h3>But why the handcuffs?</h3>
<p>Let me give you a very common situation which might lead an officer to detain someone in handcuffs.</p>
<p>The <b>911 Call Center</b> received a phone call. The call taker hears <i>screaming</i> in the background before the call drops.</p>
<p>Modern Call Centers can track where a call originated from if it is associated with an address.</p>
<p>The officer arrives at the address; let's say it is a <b>residence.</b></p>
<p>While approaching the house, the officer hears <i>screaming</i>.</p>
<p>A woman runs out of the front door with a man <i>chasing her, screaming for her to "get back here".</i></p>
<h3>What do you think is happening? Is this a <i>volatile situation?</i> Is anyone acting in a <i>threatening manner?</i> </h3>
<p>This is a common domestic situation officers find themselves in. They have very little information,
  almost next to no context, and they must make a decision right then and there.</p>
  <h3>What decision would <b>YOU</b> make?</h3>
  <p>During my time as an officer, I would approach this situation as follows:</p>
  <p>Separate the two, but keep both of them within my line of sight.</p>
  <p>Have the two stand or sit in an area <b>I have checked</b> and know is free of weapons.</p>
  <p>That means no kitchen (knives), garages (tools), or couches (weapons under cushions), unless I know the area is free of weapons.</p>
  <p>I proceed to talk to one at a time, while another officer is with the other individual (if possible).</p>
  <h3>But how did it come to pulling out handcuffs?</h3>
  <p>If one of the individuals keeps acting aggressively and will not obey the officer's commands,
    the officer must determine if there is a safety risk.</p>
    <p><b>If the officer believes there is a safety risk, or someone may become violent,</b>
       the officer will detain everyone in handcuffs until he knows the full extent of the situation.</p>
       <p>Once the officer has completed their <i>investigation</i>, he will release everyone from handcuffs <i>UNLESS</i>
       they have determined a crime has been committed.</p>
       <h3>Common situations where you'll be detained in handcuffs.</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>If <i>Drugs</i> are Involved</li>
         <li>If <i>Weapons</i> are Readily <b>Available</b></li>
         <li>If <i>Physical Violence</i> is Being <i>Threatened</i></li>
         <li>If <b>Both Parties</b> have <i>Physical Injuries,</i> but the <i>Aggressor</i> has not been Determined</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>I carry a gun <b>legally</b> in my car. I don't want to be <i>handcuffed</i> for legally carrying a gun!</h3>
       <p>You shouldn't be, and very likely will not be, unless you give the officer a reason to suspect you're <i>a threat to yourself or others.</i></p>
       <p><b>Detaining in handcuffs</b> is a measure to de-escalate a <i>volatile situation</i> before <b>Use of Force</b> is necessary.</p>
       <p>If an officer says he is putting you in handcuffs during his investigation, it is best to comply and not resist.</p>
