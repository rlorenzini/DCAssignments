<h1><b>Common Interactions</b> with Officers</h1>
<p>Officers love to play Twenty Questions and use technical words.</p>
<p>Interacting with the police can be <i>intimidating</i>.</p>
<p>Yet an officer is just a person doing a job. They want the same respect and courtesy you'd show anyone else.</p>
<h3>When will I interact with an Officer?</h3>
<p>If you <b>call 911</b>, are <b>inside a business</b> which calls 911, or are <b>witness</b> to a possible <i>crime or accident</i>,
  an officer will ask you questions regarding what you may have seen.</p>
<p>There is no reason to become <i>alarmed</i> when an officer approaches you.</p>
<p>A routine reaction may go as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"My name is <b>Officer Lorenzini</b> and I am with the <b>Cobb County Police Department</b>."</li>
  <li>"I need to ask you a few questions regarding the <b>recent incident</b>."</li>
  <li>"What is your <b>name/address/phone number</b>? May I see your <b>ID</b>?"</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why does an officer need my <b>Driver's License/State ID</b>?</h3>
<p>Officers run names all day long. By using a <b>government issued identification card</b>, not only does it save the officer
<i>time and effort</i>, it allows them to retrieve your <b>information</b> later if needed.</p>
<p>Until an officer can <b>identify you in the system</b>, you will be <i>detained</i>.</p>
<p>Would you rather provide your ID or wait for an officer to find you <b>BY NAME</b>? How many people share your name?</p>
<p>Using an ID also allows <b>other officers</b> listening over the radio to run your information for the officer.</p>
<p>As you can probably see, this helps an officer in many ways.</p>
<p>An officer asking for an ID <b>does not</b> imply you are <i>guilty</i> of anything.</p>
