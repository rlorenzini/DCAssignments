	<h1>Interacting with Police Officers</h1>
	<p>
    As a former police officer, one of the most common questions I get from citizens is how to interact with police officers.</p>
  <p>On this website you will find information on who a police officer is, what they are doing, and understanding what they are saying.
	</p>
  <p>What is "being detained", and how will I know when an officer has detained me?</p>
  <p>When can an officer search my person, my vehicle, my house, or my property?</p>
  <p>How do I communicate with an officer?</p>
  <p>What do I do when my rights have been violated by an officer?</p>
	<p>What are Miranda Rights, and when does an officer read them?</p>
  <p>The next time you have an interaction with an officer, you'll be more mentally prepared and able
  to understand what the officer is saying and what they are doing.</p>
